# ccd 

ccd is a really simple tool for moving around the file system faster.
It allows you to create shortcuts to directories rather than typing
out the whole path.

## Usage

$ ccd foo # cds to the directory associated with the "foo" shortcut

$ ccd add bar # makes "bar" a ccd shortcut to the current directory

$ ccd list # displays the mapping of shortcuts to directories

## Installation

Just clone the repository to where ever you want, cd into it, and run ./install.
Note that you must be in the repository directory, since the install script uses pwd.
It will append a few lines onto your .bashrc file, so if you have some other setup
take a look at the install script and change it as appropriate.
