# g 

g is a really simple tool for moving around the file system faster.
It allows you to create shortcuts to directories rather than typing
out the whole path.

The whole thing is tiny enough that you can read through/modify it easily.
The name was chosen primarily because its one letter.

## Usage

$ g foo # cds to the directory associated with the "foo" shortcut

$ g add bar # makes "bar" a g shortcut to the current directory

$ g list # displays the mapping of shortcuts to directories

## Known problems

Since this is just using grep to get the mapping out of the dictionary,
you might get the wrong one if one shortcut is a prefix of another shortcut.
You can avoid this problem by putting the longer shortcut before the prefix.

## Installation

Just clone the repository to wherever you want, cd into it, and run ./install (then
restart you terminal).
Note that you must be in the repository directory, since the install script uses pwd.
It will append a few lines onto your .bashrc file, so if you have some other setup
take a look at the install script and change it as appropriate.
